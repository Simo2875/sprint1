## Attendance and Participation

Members of the team are expected to attend all scheduled meetings, occurring twice a week, on Fridays at 2pm, and on Tuesdays at 10am. If a member is unable to attend, notify the other group members at least two hours prior to the meeting.

### Consequences for Missing Meetings:

All unnotified missed meetings will be logged.

- First offense: a verbal warning will be issued
- Second offense: offender must buy all other group members coffee
- Third offense: offender must write a written apology

Continued offenses may result in a member being removed from the group.

## Discrimination and Harassment

No member in the group should be made to feel lower than any other member, and all members should feel safe, regardless of:

- Background
- Family status
- Gender
- Gender identity or expression
- Marital status
- Sex
- Sexual orientation
- Native language
- Age
- Ability
- Race and/or ethnicity
- Caste
- National origin
- Socioeconomic status

- Geographic location

## Plagiarism

All work contributed by members must be original work, and citations/references must be shown where external sources are used. We do not want to risk the integrity of our work based on the actions of a sole individual.

## Job Duties

1. All members are expected to complete their assigned tasks given to them in the meetings, and these must be completed to the best of the members' abilities.
2. Effective communication is needed, and where a member may feel that they are unable to complete a task or require assistance, they must reach out to the other members of the group, notifying them.
3. Failure to keep job duties may result in the reassignment of tasks, or action may be taken.

## Expected Behavior

### Respect

All members should be treated with respect and kindness. Disagreements are bound to happen eventually, but we are all working toward the same goal.

### Confidentiality

Respect the confidentiality of group discussions, plans, and work created and shared within the group. They are not to be shared with other groups.

### Directness

Criticism is necessary to improve, and we must be able to speak directly, though this does not mean a member must be unnecessarily harsh to another member. Honesty and directness are needed, but so is respectfulness.

## Future Modifications to Guidelines

There may be changes made to this code of conduct, and all group members will be notified before and after a change is made, ensuring that there is no excuse to not be updated with the current code of conduct. These changes will also be brought up within group meetings.

## Conclusion

By participating in this group, each member understands that they will follow this code of conduct, so that we can build a positive and productive environment, where all members feel valued and respected. If a member has any questions, ask through whatever available mediums there are.
